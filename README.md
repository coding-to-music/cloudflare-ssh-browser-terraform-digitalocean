# ðŸ‘· Browser-based SSH using Cloudflare & Terraform

Tutorial code demonstrating how to implement Zero Trust, browser based SSH authentication to access a Digitalocean VM.
Most of the set up is fully automated using Terraform.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # data.digitalocean_droplet.ssh_droplet will be read during apply
  # (depends on a resource or a module with changes pending)
 <= data "digitalocean_droplet" "ssh_droplet" {
